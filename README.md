## Concerning Copyright
This program requires two external files to function: a video, and a subtitles file (often a .srt file). The video is ,in the vast majority of cases, under the ownership of the copyright holder, as well as the text contained within the corresponding subtitles file (including the case wherein you add the timestamps yourself). Even if the video is legally obtained, and the text is acquired from a site that paid for a distribution license (as is often the case with sites that host song lyrics), converting the text into a captions format like .srt and using it alongside the video may not be legal, even if the use is personal and educational. The same can be said for distributing either file. I am not qualified to give legal advice, and your use of media with this program is at your own risk.
