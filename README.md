## Features
- Highlighting words in the subtitles reveals possible definitions
- Dedicated button for creating timestamps (make .srt files quickly!)
- Supports Japanese -> English vocabulary
### What's new in v1.1.0?
- Preview tooltip on the progress bar
- Keyboard shortcuts for commonly used actions
- User interface improvements
- Changing the subtitles file automatically updates it in TangoPlusElectron

## How does it work?
This program features an in-app tutorial.
### 1) Download and start the app
[MacOSX](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpe/TangoPlusElectron-mac.zip), v1.0.1
Windows _(coming soon)_  
### 2) Start the tutorial
Using the two white buttons in the bottom right, load the .mp4 and .srt files included with the download. The first will start the video, and the second will load the subtitles. You can see what those buttons look like in the image at the top of this document.

## Concerning Copyright
This program requires two external files to function: a video, and a subtitles file (often a .srt file). The video is, in the vast majority of cases, under the ownership of the copyright holder, as well as the text contained within the corresponding subtitles file (including the case wherein you add the timestamps yourself). Even if the video is legally obtained, and the text is acquired from a site that paid for a distribution license (as is often the case with sites that host song lyrics), converting the text into a captions format like .srt and using it alongside the video may not be legal, even if the use is personal and educational. The same can be said for distributing either file. I am not qualified to give legal advice, and your use of media with this program is at your own risk.
